# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

Additional features:
- A robot snake (obstacle) that grows in length and speed at reduced rate of player's snake 
- It will compete with the player for food but not consuming the food, i.e. stay nearby the food
- Special food (blue) to reduce the speed of robot snake, green food to reduce the length of robot snake by half 

# Rubic:
The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques. 
Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
Classes encapsulate behavior.
Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters.
Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.

The project makes use of references in function declarations.
The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers
